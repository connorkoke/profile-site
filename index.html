          <h2>Location</h2>
<p>Grand Canyon National Park is in the northwest corner of Arizona. The Colorado River flows through the canyon, comprised from water from seven states, yet the feature we know as Grand Canyon is entirely in Arizona.</p>

          <h2>Notable Nature</h2>
          <p>The Park contains several major ecosystems. Its great biological diversity can be attributed to the presence of five of the seven life zones and three of the four desert types in North America.
               The five life zones represented are the Lower Sonoran, Upper Sonoran, Transition, Canadian, and Hudsonian. This is equivalent to traveling from Mexico to Canada.</p>
